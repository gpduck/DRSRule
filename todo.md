#### ToDo items for DRSRule module
- for [Issue #2](https://github.com/PowerCLIGoodies/DRSRule/issues/2), add ability to remove one or more target items from a DRS VMGroup or VMHost group via `Set-DrsVMGroup`, `Set-DrsVMHostGroup`
	- also, investigate other item reported in that issue of a problem "when the user wants to remove all VMs from a VM group. That errors out"
	- in branch `enha_RemoveItemFromGrp`, added `-AddVM` and `-RemoveVM` parameters to `Set-DrsVMGroup` for easier adds and removes of VMs to/from DRS VM group
- look into possibility of increasing speed in `Get-DrsVMGroup` (somewhat slow in medium to large environments)
- add [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester) tests
	- `New-Drs*`, `Set-Drs*`, `Remove-Drs*` tests
- add SDRS rule support
- add ability to specify prefix for names of new objects during Import
- add support for `[string[]]` values to `-Name` param for `Get-DrsVMGroup`, `Get-DrsVMHostGroup`
- add `-Type` param for `Import-DrsRule`, so one can import just rules/groups of given type
- add verbosity to `WhatIf` info for
	- New/Set-DrsVMHostGroup output -- include VMHosts' names
	- New/Set-DrsVMGroup output -- include VMs' names
- add ability to rename groups/rules via `Set-Drs*` functions
- ?remove spots that re-assign values to param vars (use new var name instead of re-using param name, like `$VM = $VM | %{...do something...})`; there is slight weirdness when acting on those further:  `ValidateScript()` seems to run again, and if the var is not of the given type, throws `The variable cannot be validated because the value System.Management.Automation.PSObject[] is not a valid value for the VMHost variable.`, for example, but later on in the function, not at the start
- update `Get-Drs*` behavior to match standard `Get-*` cmdlets' behavior of returning error when no item found of given name when `$Name` has no wildcard:
	- `Get-DrsVMGroup bogusGroupName` should throw error
- add function to get objects from exported JSON, to essentially return info items that could be used for `New-Drs*`, but that would be useful to see what items are stored in given JSON
